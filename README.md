# JS Query
### A few little cheats for those trying to become _jQuery_-free.
It's not a very extensive replacement for _jQuery_, just a few things my projects have used the most.

I have nothing against _jQuery_, I have been putting this together while actually learning _real_ "Vanilla" JavaScript. I will continue to add to it as I find use for additions, but probably not just to add them. [Here's an article I wrote about it.](https://dev.to/edlinkiii/refactoring-jquery-2klg)

## Versions
### v1.0
* First 'official' version
* Write-up: [My First Release: JS Query](https://dev.to/edlinkiii/my-first-release-1p67)
### v1.0.1
* Added .trigger(eventType)
### v1.1
* Added .hasFocus()
* Added .isDescendant(element)
* Added .isDirectDescendant(element)
* Added .isChild(element)
* Added .isParent(element)
* Added .replace(element)
* Added .replaceWith(element)
### v1.1.1
* Added .is(element)
* Modified .isDescendant() to no longer return true if the element _**is**_ the passed element
### v.1.1.2
* Renamed .is(element) to .isSelf(element)
### v.1.2.0
* Added saafety check before implementing each method
* Added $id()
* Added $class()
* Added .hasKids()
* Added .isVisible()
* Added .isHidden()
* Added .hasVal()
* Removed ajax() --> just use fetch

## Usage
```javascript
// $('#id').hide(); // jQuery
$q('#id').hide(); // js-query

// let that = $('.this-class:eq(1) .that') // jQuery
let that = $qa('.this-class')[1].find('.that') // js-query

// Chainable and completely interchangeable with Vanilla JavaScript
let el = document.getElementById('abc123');
el.html('Hello World').addClass('red').toggleClass('bold');
```

#### Caveats
* Unlike jQuery, document.querySelector is **very** strick about beginning an element's id with a letter.
* Also, document.querySelector will return null if a match is not found.
